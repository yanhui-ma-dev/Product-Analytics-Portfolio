Product Analytics & Machine Learning Portfolio
This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of data analytics and machine learning projects, bridging the gap between raw data orchestration and actionable business intelligence.

📂 Project Structure
1. Predictive Modeling Lab 1: Big Data & Feature Engineering
Focus: Spatiotemporal data orchestration and cleaning of large-scale datasets.

Key Achievement: Processed 21.8 million GPS records from Rome’s taxi network.

Technical Highlights:

Implemented high-performance cleaning for invalid coordinates and duplicated records.

Engineered trajectory metrics using the Haversine formula to calculate distance and instantaneous speed.

Identified operational patterns and driver activity duration metrics.

2. Predictive Modeling Lab 2: Risk Intelligence & Model Benchmarking
Focus: Supervised and unsupervised learning for financial risk assessment.

Key Achievement: Benchmarked multiple algorithms to optimize creditworthiness prediction accuracy.

Technical Highlights:

Multi-Model Evaluation: Compared Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

Advanced Evaluation: Utilized ROC Curves and AUC metrics (achieving 0.8524 for SVM) to validate model reliability.

Strategic Optimization: Implemented a "Reject Option" (402040 logic) to manage prediction confidence thresholds.

3. Retail Analysis: RFM & Geo-temporal Insights
Focus: Customer segmentation and business growth strategy.

Key Achievement: Translated transactional data into a strategic RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework.

Technical Highlights:

Segmented 500k+ records to identify high-value customer clusters.

Provided data-driven recommendations for market retention and seasonal inventory management.

📊 Business Intelligence & Visualization (Tableau)
Interactive Dashboards: Developed executive-level dashboards to visualize customer segmentation (RFM) and geo-temporal purchasing patterns.

Actionable Insights: Enabled stakeholders to perform deep-dives into regional sales performance and seasonal trends through dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities.

Visual Storytelling: Translated R-based statistical outputs into intuitive Tableau visualizations to drive market expansion strategies.
